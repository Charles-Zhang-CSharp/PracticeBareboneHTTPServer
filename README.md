# PracticeBareboneHTTPServer

Per https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers, it looks like we can implement an HTTP server alike.
This setup intends to explore how easy it is to implement a very barebone HTTP handler (without ASP.Net Core that is!).

As it turns out, getting started is very easy.
